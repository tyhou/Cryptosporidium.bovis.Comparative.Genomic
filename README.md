# Cryptosporidium.bovis.Comparative.Genomic-
*Cryptosporidium bovis* is a common parasite infecting post-weaned calves. It differs from the zoonotic species *Cryptosporidium parvum* in terms of host range, age distribution, and pathogenicity. Therefore, genomic data from *C. bovis* are useful for understanding the evolution of host infectivity and virulence of *Cryptosporidium* spp. In this study, we sequenced the genome of *C. bovis* in 23 samples from China, covering subtypes XXVIa to XXVIf. We constructed a near-chromosome-level reference genome for *C. bovis*, enabling the characterization of structural variations between *C. bovis* and *C. parvum*. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that *C. bovis* isolates cluster by farm rather than by subtype. Within-farm recombination and mixed infections further support the limited utility of single-locus subtyping. Comparative genomic analyses identified 38 highly polymorphic genes, including 18 under positive selection. This study reveals that sympatric recombination drives genomic homogenization in *C. bovis*. These findings underscore its potential as an indicator species, as its population structure reflects local infection pressure and transmission risk. These insights collectively enhance our understanding of *Cryptosporidium* evolution and transmission dynamics.
